        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            Today the world has known an expansion of Internet where anyone can publish web
            pages. With an increase of websites available online, it is important to perform evaluation
            to ensure a website is user-friendly and is responsive.
            <br><br>A well presented website is one which has accurate information, contains appropriate web
            technologies to function responsively and project readable information for a human to
            understand.<br><br>This website showcases the evaluation of four websites made on their contents,
            navigation, layout, web technologies used, overall functionality and user experience. The websites
            are as follows:
        </p>

    <section id="sectionl">
        <h2><a href="apple.html">Apple</a></h2>
        <p class="pl">
            
        <img src="images/apple.png" alt="Apple Logo" height="165" width="165"></p>
    </section>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            After an analysis of each website has been made, it can be seen that the core concept of any
            website is to adopt a beautiful design and that contain relevant information. With a proper
            design, users are automatically interested to know about the content of the website.
            Regarding the content, a user might be interested in taking a tour of the website to know 
            more about its purpose and can discover design ideas that are implemented in the website.
            <br><br>
            As a web developer, it is very important to take into consideration the design phase of any
            website that you are working on. If the design is not appealing even though the information
            is relevant, the user might not be interested to visit the website again. This website included
            the description of four websites, that is, two I like (Apple and Samsung) and two I dislike
            (Msn and Yahoo) that were explained with details found in the other web pages. Feel free to 
            browse around the website.
