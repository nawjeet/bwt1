        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            Yahoo is a website that has a lot of users using their services. Yahoo also provides users
            with a service namely "Yahoo Mail" where users can interact with each other over the
            network. The website also has an abundance of information for users to read. There are information
            like News, Finance, Sport, Politics, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Daily Smile and more. It also
            contains a widget on the right where you can find news that are trending as well as the weather
            displaying the weather through IP address. There is also a Scoreboard that can be very useful to
            people who are passionate about sport. However, the information found on Yahoo are excellent but
            there are also information that stalks celebrities, opinions of people which do not count as
            resourceful for other people. There are mostly news on celebrities when viewing the homepage.

    <!-- NAVIGATION -->
    <section id="sectionl">
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            The navigation process is smooth when browsing the website. It is organised in an orderly manner
            where news are populated while users scroll down on the homepage. The website is not difficult to
            navigate and all sections are placed responsively for anyone to browse from any device. If a reader
            has clicked on one of the links, he/ she will be redirected to the article and once read, he/ she
            will see more news available that could be of interest to him/ her. Yahoo has aimed to keep users
            from reading more news and offer reliable sources. However, there are also signs of unreliable sources.

    <!-- LAYOUT -->
    <section id="sectionl">
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            The layout of Yahoo is simple and uses deep purple as its brand color. The interface is
            very realistic which makes the website beautiful. The website has a main navigation bar
            on top of the website where users can search or login to Yahoo. The body contains a 3/4 section
            on the left where main topics are shown and 1/4 section displaying Trending, Weather and Scoreboard.
            Below the section, there are sections that shows the information in title and the first line of the
            description along with the image. The layout is well designed accomodating much space for the
            articles to show up in the middle. It makes more sense and is appealing to the eyes while viewing
            the article. However, you can see the advertisements placed by Yahoo which can be annoying while
            reading or clicked unintentionally. An example can be shown below of the layout of the clicked
            article from the homepage's chosen article.

    <!-- WEB TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

        <h2>Web Technologies Used</h2>
        <p class="pl">

    <!-- OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY -->
    <section id="sectionl">
        <h2>Overall Functionality</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            The overall functionality of Yahoo is that news can be shared easily and hassle free.
            Users need not login before accessing information on their website. Yahoo users can 
            login to check their mail and can also chat for free from their website. However, the
            Yahoo Messenger is no longer available for users to chat (Yahoo Help 2018). This can be thumbs down from
            users who were fans of the web application. Moreover, users can be frustrated to see
            irrelevant news appearing on the homepage as well as stalking news popping up.

    <!-- USER EXPERIENCE -->
    <section id="sectionl">
        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        <br><img id="wty" src="images/yahoo4.png" alt="Yahoo Login Panel">
        <br><p class="pl">
            The user experience on Yahoo can be quite upright as the website is straight forward
            leading users to read information and login to the Account panel. The website seems
            lightweight and has an inspiring simple interface. Users can also use the Yahoo search
            engine to find information on the web. Overall, the website is user-friendly and all
            information can be read freely.
