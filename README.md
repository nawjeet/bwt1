# Business Web Technologies - S1 2019

## Website Evaluation

### Introduction

This website is an evaluation of 4 websites that I have chosen to evaluate on namely:

```
Apple
Samsung
Msn
Yahoo
```

The website's starting page includes a brief introduction on websites in general where it is stated that anyone around the world can publish their websites using free hosting services, such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [000WebHost](https://www.000webhost.com) service providers, or using paid hosting providers with security and peace of mind, such as [GoDaddy](https://au.godaddy.com), [IcyEvolution](https://www.icyevolution.com), [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com) and many more. To ensure that a website meets minimum standard requirements, it is required to perform evaluation on the websites' overall performance criteria. The website should be responsive, contain accurate information and developed using lightweight codes. The first page includes the logo of each website and a small bullet points that will be further elaborated in the web pages created for each website.

### Content

The content includes critiques made on the **Content**, **Navigation**, **Layout**, **Web Technologies Used**, **Overall Functionality** and **User Experience** of each website stated above. This website contains 6 html pages, 1 css file and 1 JavaScript file. The files namely, `index.html`, `apple.html`, `samsung.html`, `msn.html`, `yahoo.html`, `references.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`, can be found on my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/nawjeet/bwt1).

The first website is **Apple** which has been selected as _liked_ and has been evaluated thoroughly and displayed on the web page `apple.html`. The web page has small descriptions and pictures of the main website displayed. Below are the main points that has been described in each web page. Apple is a leader in the technology world where its creations are signs of simplicity and uniqueness. The company adhers to create innovative ideas and ensure that customers' satisfaction are put ahead of their work. They believe in simple things which can make a big impact on the way people see things. Apple aims at creating visually appealing animations and fonts.

> Innovative ideas and design

> Responsive and smooth website

> Appealing visual literacy


The second website is **Samsung** that has also been evaluted as _liked_ and below shows the main characteristics of the website of Samsung that has been evaluated. Samsung is another global leader that is a competitor to the above one. The company has been in the market since long ago; delivering new ideas and skills on the table. This website is a responsive one and assures user satisfaction with various pages displaying its latest technologies.

> User-friendly website

> Individual/ Enterprise Business Technologies

> Mega Menu Navigation Bar

The third website is **Msn** which has been evaluated as _disliked_ for its design and its content. The creator of Msn is Microsoft. The company specialises in different sector. This specific website portrays news around the world and does not focus on the design as much as the level of information. However, the some information available on the website are relevant but there are also irrelevant information which do not have facts and figures. There are also bugs in the navigation bar when scrolled down, the navigation bar crackles to the left and align back to its position.

> Pool of information around the world

> Bugs in the website interface

> Lack of category when reading news

Finally, the fourth website is **Yahoo** which is also counted as _disliked_ not for its design but for its unreliable sources that shows up on its homepage. This website has a good level of design which display simplicity and uses dark purple as the recognised brand color. The layout and elements are placed correctly, allowing users to be at ease when using the website. However, it must be noted that there are many advertisements that are among the news which are not relevant to the actual news a user is reading. To add to that, there are also more celebrities gossips news on Yahoo than on Msn. However, there are also useful resources that users can learn from this website.

> Simple interface with variety of resources

> Too many advertisements among news

> Celebrity gossip news

### Conclusion

Last but not the least, all of the specified websites have been reviewed and analysed on their content, website design style and their functionalities. Through the evaluation, it can be seen that it is imperative to focus on the design process when developing a website of any kind. Users are automatically atrracted to a website based solely on their design interface. Also, a website should be responsive while user-friendly letting users navigate the website hassle-free and access information with less navigation steps. Hence, it must be regarded as a priority to ensure the visit rate of users exceeds the expected one and ensure that the user is willing to convert to a regular happy customer.
