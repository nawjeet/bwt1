    <!-- CONTENT -->
    <section class="sectionl">
        <br><h2>Content</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            As beautiful and bold this website looks, Apple uses the idea of making giant headlines
            to bring the focus of attention to specific details of its products. The content of Apple
            is usually short containing primary and secondary headers and 2 to 3 short paragraphs.
            Apple has been leading in the tech world through its innovative and cutting edge
            products it has been delivering for a lapse of more than 30 years.
            <br><br>
            Apple has always made sure that customers should be satisfied 100% when buying their products.
            The company tends to focus more on the design to make sure the best is met and is quality-wise.
            This technique attracts more users to love the website. An example can be shown below on
            how Apple makes a lucrative content of its successor product with bold and simple
            text describing the new handset.

    <!-- NAVIGATION -->
    <section class="sectionl">
        <br><h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p class="plNav">
            Apple uses animation to make their website effective. Users can scroll to discover
            new animations in order to share a unique experience of navigation.<br><br>
            On the site of Apple, it can be seen that there are less links between the content
            and images. Apple also has a list of seven sub-items and three clear icons that can be
            easily navigated when clicked.
            <br><br>
            It can also be seen on the right that Apple has used a dropdown menu for the mobile navigation
            where all items are stacked up in a responsive scrollable manner.

    <!-- LAYOUT -->
    <section class="sectionl">
        <br><h2>Layout</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            The layout of Apple's website encompasses the web design where the website has
            adopted powerful design improvements every year when the company releases its latest
            products. It is outlined in the research of DBS Interactive (2016) stating that Apple
            is recognised for using high-quality and crisp images to enhance the visual and layout
            design. They also use a clear navigation style to showcase modern lifestyle and trending
            cutting edge technologies.<br><br>

            Apple also uses minimal colours and compact style to display the content of the website.
            Through analysis of the website, Apple used only a simple navigation bar and simple
            footer with "four smaller sections" to "highlight" its products to the world. Apple has
            concentrated more on appealing visual literacy and high quality presentation.

        <br><h2>Web Technologies Used</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            Apple has been operating since 19 February 1987 and using the following frameworks
            (W3Techs 2019):

        <br><img id="technologies" src="images/wta.png" alt="Web Technologies Logo">
        <p class="pl">
            Apple uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Apache server, OpenGraph (a Facebook service provider),
            Akamai for their cloud service provider and DigiCert for the SSL Certificate.

    <!-- OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY -->
    <section class="sectionl">
        <br><h2>Overall Functionality</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            Apple's website is fully functional where detailed contents are displayed and are very
            simple and easy to understand. In recent years, Apple has launched a new accessibility website
            for people with disabilities to use and explore the features (Sarah 2016). The company also has
            a login system which is not available on all web pages of the website.
            
            <br><br>However, Apple limits the functionality of login/ register to the <a href="https://www.icloud.com" 
            target="_blank">www.icloud.com</a> page where users can have access to their main account and manage
            their settings and changes.

    <!-- USER EXPERIENCE -->
    <section class="sectionl">
        <br><h2>User Experience</h2>
        <p class="pl">
            The user experience is mesmerising thereby creating an appealing impact when using the website. Apple
            has worked a lot to achieve this level of design and responsiveness. Hence, this website
            demonstrate high quality codes and efficiency in simplicity. Below is another example of the
            support web page of Apple.
